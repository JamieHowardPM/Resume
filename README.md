## <span style="color:#6a0dad">💬 About Me</span>
I build clarity where healthcare and technology meet.  
For 5 years, I’ve led SaaS and interoperability initiatives that make complex workflows functional, compliant, and user-focused. My foundation in healthcare operations — built over two decades as a medical interpreter — gives me a unique perspective: I understand the human impact of every system, every click, and every delay.

Now, I turn that insight into action — guiding cross-functional teams to design, deliver, and refine solutions that improve how care is coordinated, documented, and delivered. I bring technical fluency, operational empathy, and a drive for simplicity that helps teams move faster and align around what matters.

## <span style="color:#6a0dad">⚙️ How I Work</span>
I’m at my best in the space between strategy and execution — defining what success looks like, then working alongside engineers, analysts, and clinical stakeholders to make it real.  

I lead through clarity and consistency: clear requirements, clear priorities, and clear communication. I believe good products don’t just work — they *fit* within existing systems and make everyone’s job easier.

## <span style="color:#6a0dad">💜 What I Believe</span>
Great product work isn’t about features — it’s about *focus*.  
It’s about understanding who you serve, what they need, and how technology can help without getting in the way. My goal is to make healthcare technology invisible — the kind of seamless experience that lets clinicians focus on patients, not platforms.
