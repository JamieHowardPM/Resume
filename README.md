## <span style="color:#6a0dad">💬 About Me</span>
I build clarity where healthcare and technology meet.  
For 5 years, I’ve led SaaS and interoperability initiatives that make complex workflows functional, compliant, and user focused. My foundation in healthcare operations, built over two decades as a medical interpreter, gives me a practical perspective. I understand the human impact of every system, every click, and every delay.

I turn that insight into action by guiding cross-functional teams to design, deliver, and refine solutions that improve how care is coordinated, documented, and delivered. I bring technical fluency, operational empathy, and a drive for simplicity that helps teams move faster and align around what matters.

## <span style="color:#6a0dad">⚙️ How I Work</span>
I’m at my best in the space between strategy and execution: define what success looks like, then work alongside engineers, analysts, and clinical stakeholders to make it real.  

I lead through clarity and consistency: clear requirements, clear priorities, and clear communication. Good products don’t just work — they fit within existing systems and make everyone’s job easier.

## <span style="color:#6a0dad">💜 What I Believe</span>
Great product work isn’t about features. It’s about focus.  
It starts with understanding who you serve, what they need, and how technology can help without getting in the way. My goal is to make healthcare technology feel invisible — a seamless experience that lets clinicians focus on patients, not platforms.
